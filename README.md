# Portfolio Site

This directory contains a simple static website that showcases your Streamlit apps and product artifacts.  It is built with vanilla HTML and CSS for maximum portability.

## How to Use

1. Unzip the `portfolio_site` directory if you received it as a ZIP.
2. **Replace all placeholders** in `index.html` with real URLs:
   - `__LIVE_DEMO_RISK__`: Link to the live deployment of your Fintech Risk Mini‑App.
   - `__CODE_RISK__`: Link to the source code repository (e.g. GitHub) for the Fintech Risk Mini‑App.
   - `__LIVE_DEMO_CRYPTO__`: Link to the live deployment of your Crypto Insights App.
   - `__CODE_CRYPTO__`: Link to the source code repository for the Crypto Insights App.
   - `__PRD_LINK__`: Link to your Inventory Tracker PRD (for example, a Markdown file on GitHub or a Google Doc).
   - `__GROWTH_LINK__`: Link to your Lead Gen Growth Experiment write‑up.
   - `__RESUME_LINK__`: Link to your resume (PDF or webpage).
   - `__GITHUB_USERNAME__`: Replace with your GitHub username.
3. Open `index.html` locally in your web browser to verify that all links work and the site displays correctly.
4. Deploy the site to your preferred static host:
   - **GitHub Pages**: commit the files to a repository and enable Pages under Settings.
   - **Netlify**: drag and drop the folder into the Netlify dashboard.
   - **Vercel**: import the repository and set the framework to static.
